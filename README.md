# Statistics

This is a project I began independently in attempt to automate finding simple single and multiple regression diagnostics. As input, the script takes a txt document with inputs such as dataset directory, type of regression, directory for output, etc. It will output necessary plots, such as the residual and normal propability plots, and a txt file with quantitative information, such as the ANOVA table and other hypothesis tests.
